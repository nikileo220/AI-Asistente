Asistente virtual.

My project aims to develop a virtual assistant with artificial intelligence using Python. The assistant will be capable of answering questions, performing specific tasks, and even carrying out natural language conversations. To achieve this, I will be using natural language processing (NLP) libraries, machine learning, and neural networks of OpenAI databases. The main goal is to create a useful and efficient tool to help users in their day-to-day activities.
